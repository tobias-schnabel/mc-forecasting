    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This method imputes missing values in panel data for electricity generation forecasts across multiple countries. It leverages the cross-sectional relationships between countries to estimate missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Panel Data Utilization**: Exploits the relationships between different countries' data.\n",
    "2. **Temporal Consistency**: Processes data chronologically to ensure consistency and use of the most recent available information.\n",
    "3. **Minimal Assumptions**: Doesn't impose fixed relationships between countries or assume any specific time series model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each day with missing data:\n",
    "   a. Identify missing values for each country.\n",
    "   b. For each missing value:\n",
    "      - Use data from the same hour of the previous day to compute weights for other countries.\n",
    "      - Calculate a weighted average of other countries' values for the missing time point.\n",
    "      - Impute the missing value with this weighted average.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Weights are determined by the relative values of other countries in the previous day's corresponding hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Countries with missing data in the previous day are excluded from the calculation to ensure reliability.\n",

    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapts to changing relationships between countries over time.\n",
    "- Preserves the relative influence of different countries.\n",
    "- Handles missing data in a way that's consistent with the panel structure of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumes relative stability in cross-country relationships from one day to the next.\n",
    "- May not capture longer-term trends or seasonal patterns.\n",
    "- Effectiveness may be reduced if there are extended periods of missing data across multiple countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",

    "```python\n",
    "imputed_data = impute_missing_values(original_data)\n",
